The Audio and Video Proctoring modules were created as a part of proctored exam tool. 
Basic face and body positioning along with eye tracking, stress detection and audio detection are implemented using computer vision techniques.

The motivation behind creating this module was to overcome the challenges and shortcomings in the existing exam proctoring tools. 
1. Some do undercuttings 
2. Some show genuine signs of anxiety
3. Some take external help
etc
Each candidate has different experience and needs and this project was an attempt to cater few of those challenges.
